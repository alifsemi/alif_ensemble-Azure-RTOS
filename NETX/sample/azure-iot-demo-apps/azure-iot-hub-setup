Create an IoT Hub
=================
You should have valid Azure subscription to use the Azure IoT services.
You can use Azure CLI to create an IoT hub that handles events and messaging for your device.

To create an IoT hub:
=====================
1. In your CLI console, run the az extension add command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your CLI shell. The IOT Extension adds IoT Hub, IoT Edge, and IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS) specific commands to Azure CLI.

$ az extension add --name azure-iot

2. Run the az group create command to create a resource group. The following command creates a resource group named MyResourceGroup in the eastus region.
Note: Optionally, to set an alternate location, run az account list-locations to see available locations. Then specify the alternate location in the following command in place of eastus.

$ az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus

3. Run the az iot hub create command to create an IoT hub. It might take a few minutes to create an IoT hub.
YourIotHubName. Replace this placeholder below with the name you chose for your IoT hub. An IoT hub name must be globally unique in Azure. This placeholder is used in the rest of this tutorial to represent your unique IoT hub name.

$ az iot hub create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name {YourIoTHubName}

4. After the IoT hub is created, view the JSON output in the console, and copy the hostName value to a safe place. You use this value in a later step. The hostName value looks like the following example:
{Your IoT hub name}.azure-devices.net

Register an IoT Hub device
==========================
In this section, you create a new device instance and register it with the Iot hub you created. You will use the connection information for the newly registered device to securely connect your physical device in a later section.
To register a device:

1. In your console, run the az iot hub device-identity create command. This creates the simulated device identity.
YourIotHubName 	: Replace this placeholder below with the name you chose for your IoT hub.
myiotdevice		: You can use this name directly for the device in CLI commands in this tutorial. Optionally, use a different name.

$az iot hub device-identity create --device-id myiotdevice --hub-name {YourIoTHubName}

2. After the device is created, view the JSON output in the console, and copy the deviceId and primaryKey values to use in a later step.
Confirm that you have the copied the following values from the JSON output to use in the next section:
• hostName
• deviceId
• primaryKey

*********************************************************************
Constant name					Value 
*********************************************************************
HOST_NAME				{Your IoT hub hostName value} 
DEVICE_ID				{Your deviceID value} 
DEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY	{Your primaryKey value}

These values need to be updated in sample_config.h from azure iot demo project
