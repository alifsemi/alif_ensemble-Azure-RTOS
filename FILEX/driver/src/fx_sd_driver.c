    /* There are several useful/important pieces of information contained in
       the media structure, some of which are supplied by FileX and others
       are for the driver to setup. The following is a summary of the
       necessary FX_MEDIA structure members:

       FX_MEDIA Member                    Meaning

       fx_media_driver_request             FileX request type. Valid requests from
       FileX are as follows:

       FX_DRIVER_READ
       FX_DRIVER_WRITE
       FX_DRIVER_FLUSH
       FX_DRIVER_ABORT
       FX_DRIVER_INIT
       FX_DRIVER_BOOT_READ
       FX_DRIVER_RELEASE_SECTORS
       FX_DRIVER_BOOT_WRITE
       FX_DRIVER_UNINIT

       fx_media_driver_status              This value is RETURNED by the driver.
       If the operation is successful, this
       field should be set to FX_SUCCESS for
       before returning. Otherwise, if an
       error occurred, this field should be
       set to FX_IO_ERROR.

       fx_media_driver_buffer              Pointer to buffer to read or write
       sector data. This is supplied by
       FileX.

       fx_media_driver_logical_sector      Logical sector FileX is requesting.

       fx_media_driver_sectors             Number of sectors FileX is requesting.

       The following is a summary of the optional FX_MEDIA structure members:

       FX_MEDIA Member                              Meaning

       fx_media_driver_info                Pointer to any additional information
       or memory. This is optional for the
       driver use and is setup from the
       fx_media_open call. The SD disk uses
       this pointer for the SD disk memory
       itself.

       fx_media_driver_write_protect       The DRIVER sets this to FX_TRUE when
       media is write protected. This is
       typically done in initialization,
       but can be done anytime.

       fx_media_driver_free_sector_update  The DRIVER sets this to FX_TRUE when
       it needs to know when clusters are
       released. This is important for FLASH
       wear-leveling drivers.

       fx_media_driver_system_write        FileX sets this flag to FX_TRUE if the
       sector being written is a system sector,
       e.g., a boot, FAT, or directory sector.
       The driver may choose to use this to
       initiate error recovery logic for greater
       fault tolerance.

       fx_media_driver_data_sector_read    FileX sets this flag to FX_TRUE if the
       sector(s) being read are file data sectors,
       i.e., NOT system sectors.

       fx_media_driver_sector_type         FileX sets this variable to the specific
       type of sector being read or written. The
       following sector types are identified:

    FX_UNKNOWN_SECTOR
        FX_BOOT_SECTOR
        FX_FAT_SECTOR
        FX_DIRECTORY_SECTOR
        FX_DATA_SECTOR

                       media_ptr -> fx_media_driver_write_protect

                       The fx_media_driver_free_sector_update flag is used to instruct
                       FileX to inform the driver whenever sectors are not being used.
                       This is especially useful for FLASH managers so they don't have
                       maintain mapping for sectors no longer in use.

                       The fx_media_driver_write_protect flag can be set anytime by the
                       driver to indicate the media is not writable.  Write attempts made
                       when this flag is set are returned as errors.  */
